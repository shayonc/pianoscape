# PianoScape

PianoScape is a mobile application that connects to a digital keyboard. As students play the keyboard, the application tracks the key presses and presents feedback. The application displays music sheets of choice, and assists students in terms of playing the correct notes/chords. Music sheets are imported into the application via scanned sheets. This can include music sheets from standardized piano books, such as the RCM book series. These features would allow students to learn to play piano without taking part in expensive lessons from instructors. PianoScape would also aid students in practicing more effectively on their own, even if they choose to take lessons.
